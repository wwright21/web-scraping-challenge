# web-scraping-challenge

This is a full-stack web-scraping project which reads in data from several online sources for the planet Mars. Pertinent data include imagery, planetary facts, and recent news headlines for exploratory missions. 

The data is then stored in a Mongo database and rendered to the web with a Flask application and hosted via Github pages.
